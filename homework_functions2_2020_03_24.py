# 1.
# It's the end of the school year and you need to compile report cards.
# Write a function that says whether a student passes or fails, depending
# on their final exam grade.

# If the grade is 70 points or more (up to 100), the student "Passes".
# Otherwise, the student "Fails"

# Examples:
# report(65) should say "Fails"
# report(92) should say "Passes"



# 2.
# Key-chan and Heibu just finished a game of Scrabble. Given their scores
# k and h (for Key-chan and Heibu, respectively), report who won the game
# with a function scrabble(k, h)

# If they have the same score, report "Tie"

# Examples:
# scrabble(153, 123) should say "Key-chan"
# scrabble(299, 301) should say "Heibu"
# scrabble(125, 125) should say "Tie"
